## About

OpenHacker is an online competition for hackers of all sorts. Whether you're a hardware hacker, a kickass javascript dev, or a Ruby Rockstar. We feature a new challenge every week, each with a theme that inspires creativity. After the weekly submission period ends, participants are asked to vote on eachothers projects.
