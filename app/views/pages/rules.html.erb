	<li><h3>You cannot modify your entry after submission.</h3><span>Please do not modify your submission after submitting it to The Challenge.</span></li><br>

</ul>

<span>Multiple rule violations may result in your account being banned from the site. We also reserve the right to ban or disqualify you for any reason we see fit. We hate to do this, but since we're giving away prizes we must enforce the rules.
